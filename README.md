# lecture-pegs

This repo holds the slides for the lecture `PEGs, Packrats and Parser Combinators`.
It was originally part of the [Compiler Construction course](https://github.com/onierstrasz/course-compiler-construction) at the University of Bern.
This version of the slides have been prepared as part of a guest lecture for the [new Compiler Construction course](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/teaching/current/cc/).

These slides represent the initial introductory material for the first hour of the lecture.
Part 2 consists of a live demo using [Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com).
(See the `PetitParser SPL case study` pages in the GT Book.)
